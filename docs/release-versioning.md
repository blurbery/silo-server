# Release versioning

Silo uses GitHub Releases as the public record of shipped versions and their
changes. There is no historical Silo release series yet: the repository has no
release tags, and the published container images are currently identified by
`latest`, `nightly`, or a commit SHA.

## Version format

Release tags follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with a leading
`v`:

- Stable release: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, for example `v1.2.0`
- Prerelease: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-SUFFIX`, for example `v0.1.0-alpha.1`

For releases below `v1.0.0`, a minor release may include breaking changes. Every
release note must call out upgrade, configuration, and compatibility impact when
applicable.

## Source of truth

The Git tag and matching GitHub Release are the authoritative product version.
Other version-like values in the repository describe dependencies, protocols,
or compatibility targets and are not Silo release numbers. The build details in
the admin interface continue to show the commit SHA for exact traceability.

GitHub automatically supplies source archives for each release. Container
publishing remains independent: the registry currently contains `latest`,
`nightly`, and commit-SHA tags, while the current default-branch workflow
publishes `latest` and commit-SHA tags. Versioned container tags are not
introduced by this release process.

## Release notes

GitHub generates the initial notes from merged pull requests and contributors.
The categories in [`.github/release.yml`](../.github/release.yml) group features,
fixes, documentation, dependency updates, and uncategorized changes. Maintainers
should review the generated text and add any important upgrade guidance before
announcing a release.

## Publishing a release

1. Confirm the intended commit is on `main` and required checks are green.
2. Open **Actions > Release > Run workflow** from the `main` branch.
3. Enter a new SemVer tag and select whether it is a prerelease.
4. Review the generated draft and add any required upgrade notes.
5. Publish and announce the release only after its tag, target commit, and notes
   have been verified.

The workflow rejects non-SemVer tags, mismatched prerelease settings, and runs
from branches other than `main`. It also refuses to reuse a release tag or create
a release when there are no commits since the previous one.

This process does not choose or create Silo's first version. The first tag must
be agreed by the maintainers before the workflow is run.
